## Course Material

This is a *pre-introductory course in computer science*, with an emphasis on problem solving and algorithmic thinking. This course is designed to give you an overview of a variety of computer science topics while also reflecting on the societal implications of computing and technology in general.

Computing/ computer science is one of the biggest forces of innovation and societal transformation of today. You will gain exposure to some of the fundamental components of computer science, including problem decomposition, algorithm design, software construction and testing, recursion, arithmetic and logical operations, and conditional execution. While this course is about concept beyond one programming language, we will be using a visual programming language, Snap!, to explore these concepts. You will gain experience programming individually, as well as in pairs (using pair-programming, an industry-standard software engineering practice). This course is designed for potential majors (though it does not count towards the major) and non­-majors alike. Upon completion, you will have enhanced reasoning and logic skills that will serve you well in many disciplines.



## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this course, you will be expected to be able to:
* Explain selected core concepts in computer science.
* Discuss the history and societal impact of computing.
* Convert between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
* Solve problems via analytical reasoning and by decomposing them into components (reusable code segments).
* Design, develop, and implement algorithms to solve problems.
* Understand and apply iteration, conditional execution, and recursion.
* Program alone and in pairs using a spreadsheet and Snap.


## Data Science
This course fulfills one of the required courses for the Data Science Minor. Data Science is the use of quantitative data to describe the world. The theoretical foundation is based in mathematics and computer science; the practical applied meanings come from interpreting the data in the context from which it arose. However, data science cannot exist outside of its larger issues of ethics and fairness. The Data Science minor provides students with fundamental tools in statistics and computing, experience applying those tools in two different departments in the social sciences and/or natural sciences, and consideration of broader societal implications raised by data science and its capabilities.


## Textbook

There is no textbook to purchase for this course. All materials are freely available online and will be available on Moodle.



## Honor Code
By signing/typing the Honor Pledge, you assert that you have followed the applicable collaboration policies, understand all material (code and text) submitted, and are __capable of recreating it without assistance__. The point of pair/group assignments is for you to learn from each other, NOT for you to split up the work to do in isolation---work together, taking turns. Many labs include code samples. It is a violation of the Honor Code to obtain code or materials from other internet sites for submissions in this course or to use materials obtained in this manner. In general, unless otherwise specified, __it is a violation of the Honor Code to obtain code from others (at SU or otherwise) or to consult materials from previous offerings of this course__. For all assignments, you (or your partner) must have written or typed the submission, and you must personally understand each submission well enough that you could recreate it on your own. For pair or group programming assignments, which will be clearly indicated, it is understood that any person in the pair or group may write any of the code (try to break it up evenly), but it may should be shared directly with other pairs/groups.



## Attendance
Class attendance is expected and required. Assignments are still due regardless of attendance, and you are responsible for making up all missed in-class material. Feel free to come to office hours with specific questions, but lectures will not be repeated there, so I encourage you to acquire contact information from your classmates as soon as possible. Missing more than ten percent of a given class (arriving late, leaving early, sleeping or otherwise inattentive in class) may be considered an absence.

I will take attendance using an sign-in sheet. (Signing in a classmate who is not in attendance will constitute an Honor Code violation.) On days with assigned reading (usually one each week), you will also acknowledge whether or not you completed and/or attempted the assigned reading under the Honor Code and this will factor into the quiz component of your final grade. If you did not do the assigned reading and it notably affects your participation, you may be asked to leave and it will be considered an unexcused absence.

For each absence, you are expected to do the following: Send me an email at least 1 hour before the start of class stating that you will be absent for that particular class. You do not need to tell me why; you simply need to inform me in advance. However, if you believe the absence is excused under university policy, you must also provide me with sufficient information to determine that. Even if you mention a future absence to me in person, you must still send me an email with details about your absence. Provided you do this, the absence will have no direct impact on your grade. Failing to do this will result in two percentage points being deducted for the absence.

Note that this policy applies to all absences, even those deemed excused under university policy (e.g. university­-sponsored activities, absences due to religious and cultural traditions). The Excused Absence Policy requires students to notify the professor as far in advance as possible, and to complete missed work. Though university policy does not consider illness to be an excused absence, I encourage you to use your best judgment in such situations, particularly if you may be contagious. Extenuating circumstances that prevent you from contacting me in advance will be handled on a case­-by-­case basis.

If you have five or more unexcused absences (whether or not you have followed the procedures above), you may be involuntarily withdrawn from the course.



## Engaged Participation
I expect you to be physically and mentally in class and prepared each day. You are expected to read the sections of the text assigned by the beginning of the week (__Actually read the readings!__). Come to class with questions!
Working with others while programming is an important skill. Whether working alone or with others, you are expected to be respectful of your classmates and the instructor. There is something to be learned from every pairing, and you can learn as much (if not more) from explaining a concept as hearing about it.

Be willing to answer questions and participate actively in discussions. Contributions that exemplify Paideia moments (where you "apply the thinking, modes of analysis, creativity, etc., from this class to either another class or to another aspect of life," per President Burger) are highly encouraged. Remember that although we are learning the basics of computer science, programming and problem solving skills are actually tools that have important applications in the world beyond our class.

Your participation grade does not reflect that you always had the correct answer, but rather that you were prepared for class, involved and engaged in the classroom, physically and mentally present, focused on the course material, and respectful of others.




## Assignments/Labs
The largest component of your grade in this course relates to assignments and labs. Each of these labs will be completed in pairs that will shuffle each week using pair-programming techniques. It is the responsibility of each pair that both students understand the material and could recreate the generated code on their own.

Most weeks, two of the three class periods will be dedicated to labs. Computing is a skill, and some learn skills faster than others. Some of you may finish labs during the class period; some of you may not. Don't rush though! Take your time and really understand the concepts (and make sure your partner does too!). The due date for each lab will be noted on Moodle. Make sure to ask plenty of questions if you are ever confused! You can ask questions in class, in office hours, or by email. While I will do my best to identify if you are not understanding something, the final responsibility is on you to let me know!

Each assignment/lab is worth 10 points. Each day late will result in a loss of 10% (1 point).


## Reading Quizzes
Quizzes will be given in class each week based on the reading for that week. No make­ups will be given. The quiz grade will be computed by dropping the lowest two grades and averaging the rest. Quizzes missed due to university-­excused absences will be dropped as well. Unless otherwise specified, quizzes are to be completed individually, without assistance (except as described above), and are pledged.


## Final Project
As part of this course, you will propose, design, and build a significant piece of software related to one of your interests. Unlike the labs, this project is designed to be completed on your own and evaluate your understanding of what we have learned over the course of the semester. The project will completed using Snap! (or, in rare cases, another programming language with explicit written permission of the instructor).

There will be four components to the project: the Proposal, the Check-In Submission, the Final Submission, and the Presentation. Details about the project, each component, and how the project will be graded will be posted on Moodle by the Midterm Exam. The final project submission is tentatively due at 11:55pm on Sunday, April 22nd.


## Biographical Presentation
Throughout the semester, each student will be required to give a 7 minute talk (plus 2-3 minutes for questions) on an important computer scientist. The schedule for the presentations is in the course calendar on Moodle. A full run-through of the presentation must be done with the instructor during the week prior to the scheduled date of the presentation in order to have time to incorporate feedback (two weeks in the case of presentations the week after Spring Break). The student must schedule time with the instructor for this run-through. Detailed grading criteria will be posted to Moodle during the first week of classes.


## Midterm and Final Exams
There is an in-class Midterm Exam (tentatively scheduled for March 8th) and a Final Exam (scheduled by the registrar on Tuesday May 8th from 8:30am-11:30am), both pledged. Make­up tests and exams may be given under special circumstances, given advanced notice or justified reasons for absence, such as an appropriately documented illness, family emergency, religious obligation, or participation in a university­-sponsored event. If you know you will be absent for a valid reason on a test or exam date, you must inform me as soon as possible so that we can arrange an alternate time for you to take the exam, preferably in advance of the rest of the class.

The Midterm exam has take-home computer-portion. It will be pledged and collaboration with classmates is strictly forbidden.




## Grading

Your final grade will be computed as follows.

Component |	Weight
---------|---------
Engaged Participation	| 5%
Quizzes |	7%
Assignments/Labs	 | 40%
Biographical Presentation	| 7%
Final Project	| 15%
Midterm Exam | 12%
Final Exam	| 14%


The grade cutoffs are listed here.

Grade | Min. Score
------|----------
A | 93%
A- |	90%
B+ |	87%
B	| 83%
B- |	80%
C+ |	77%
C	| 73%
C- |	70%
D	| 65%
D-	| 60%

They may be modified slightly at the instructor’s discretion, but only in your favor. In truly exceptional cases an A+ may be awarded. Absences may reduce the final grade, independent of these percentages. Note also that the SU course catalog indicates that in order to receive a C­-, "All required work is expected to be completed for this grade." For this course, this means that, at a minimum, projects 2 and 3 must each be submitted no more than a week late and with an average grade of at least 60% before any late penalties are applied, and that at least two­-thirds of the other assignments are submitted by their respective deadlines (note that these are necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, conditions for earning a C­-). For those taking the course on a P/D/F basis, earning at least a C­- corresponds to a P. Failure to meet these requirements means it is impossible to earn a grade higher than a D.

You are expected to keep an electronic copy of any electronic submission until you receive a grade. Failure to reply to email queries in a timely manner (as specified in the email) regarding assignments incorrectly or incompletely submitted (e.g. wrong file attached) will result in no credit given for the associated assignments, or late penalties being assigned. Any concerns regarding grading of an assignment must be brought to my attention within a week of when the item is returned to the class or feedback/grades are posted on Moodle.




## Classroom/Lab Policy

Cell phones are not to be used during class. Please set them to Do Not Disturb, not simply to vibrate. I strongly advise placing them in a bag rather than keeping them in a pocket or on your desk to avoid temptation. Should your phone ring, it will be confiscated for the remainder of the meeting in the front of the room. It is expected that when in class you will use the computers for course activities (note­taking, writing code), not for web­surfing, gaming, messaging, using Facebook, printing material for other courses, etc. You must obtain my explicit written permission to record any audio or video in the classroom. Since this course meets in a computer lab, food, drinks (except in lidded containers), and tobacco products of any kind (including e-cigarettes) are prohibited. Please be courteous to those around you.


## Accommodations

Southwestern University will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. You should contact the Center for Academic Success and Records to determine your eligibility to receive accommodations (Prothro Center for Lifelong Learning; 512­-863­-1286). Please notify me as early as possible about any required accommodations.

## Calendar and Syllabus Updates

I will maintain a detailed calendar on Moodle, and you should refer to it regularly throughout the semester. I will try to adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, but all dates and details are subject to change. In particular, project work days may be dropped to make time for covering course content if we fall behind in the schedule.



## Acknowledgments
Assignments, ideas, and text on this syllabus build on multiple courses taught by others, most especially Dan Garcia's Beauty and Joy of Computing course at UC Berkeley as well as Mark Guzdial's Computational Media at Georgia Tech and Nick Parlante's CS101 course at Stanford.
